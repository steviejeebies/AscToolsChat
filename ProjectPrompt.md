# ASCLEPIUS.TOOLS:AI assisted lifestyle diagnoses and advice
To improve patients’ lives and drastically reduce medical costs: 30% of medical costs can significantly be
reduced. Of the 100 billion euro of medical costs in the Netherlands 30% are related to people lifestyles.
This includes chronic diseases like Diabetes 2. With medical costs on the rise, funding them is becoming
more and more difficult for patients, insurance companies and governments. Most general practitioners
(GPs) only were trained to cure illnesses with medication or surgery. Even today’s medical students aren’t
thought to use lifestyle changes to cure illnesses. GPs know lifestyle change could have a positive impact.
They however lack the knowledge and time to give the patients proper advice. This results in higher
medical costs and in most cases a lower quality of life for patients.
##AI assisted lifestyle diagnoses and advice
AI assisted diagnoses could be a solution for the lack of knowledge and time of general practitioners. 
AI technology has proven it can be trained to detect certain
illnesses based on symptoms. The solution we want to build will have the following features:
1. AI will detect symptoms which are related to lifestyle and advice the general practitioner on that the best
changes in lifestyle would be. The advice could also suggest additional treatment by other experts like
dietitians or use of a digital program to support the change of lifestyle.
2. It will create a lifestyle advice for the patients with tips and practical tools to start working on lifestyle
changes.
### Interface and privacy
There are a great variety of systems used by GPs, which will make building APIs a
challenge. Next to this medical personal information should be processed in the most secure way.
Therefore, it would make sense to make the first version of the tool a standalone application where the GP
can copy and paste symptoms and patient details without personal identifiable information (PII) from his
own system to the tool. Using a chatbot might be a good interface,
as this is only a small bit of real estate on the total screen of the GP and it would be an easy interface for,
in general, less tech savvy GPs.
Innovative AI and chatbot technology: Orange Tribes has an excellent relationship with Microsoft and
could get expert support and advise on using Microsoft’s leading AI Cognitive services and Bot framework
to elevate the project to an even higher level.
We are always open for suggestions from other tech parties such as Google or Facebook or ….
### Project scope and steps
The scope of the project is to setup an MVP to:
1. Test if AI can suggest lifestyle changes based on symptoms copied from the medical record of the
patient. With maybe a chatbot asking some additional questions to improve the lifestyle treatment plan.
The suggested lifestyle treatment plan can easily be copied and paste into the GP medical system.
2. An advice of lifestyle changes in patient language with tips and practical tools which the doctor can
either print of email to the patient.
